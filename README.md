# DFS Semantics Python

This repo is essentially a python implementation (incomplete) of https://github.com/hbrouwer/dfs-tools , notably without sampling. Logic is handled by NLTK's logic package. 

The goal of this repo is to implement a traditional lambda-calculus style compositional system for Distributional Formal Semantics, i.e. vectors of truth values.
